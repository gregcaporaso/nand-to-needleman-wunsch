Project code developed while reading [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.nand2tetris.org) (i.e., "Nand to Tetris"), by Noam Nisan, Shimon Schocken.

To put a bioinformatics spin on the project, instead of Tetris, my final application is an implementation of Needlman-Wunsch pairwise sequence alignment based on the [discussion of this algorithm in *An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics*](https://readiab.org/pairwise-alignment.html#a-better-approach-for-global-pairwise-alignment-using-the-needleman-wunsch-algorithm).
